# Everything

[toc]

A paragraph with **bold**, *italic*, ~~struck~~, ==marked==, `inline code`,
H~2~O, x^2^, a [link](https://nibeditor.com), a bare https://nibeditor.com,
a wikilink to [[Another note]], an aliased one to [[Another note|the other]],
a heading link to [[Another note#Why it works]], a footnote[^why], inline
maths $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$, an abbreviation for HTML, and a #tag in prose.

[^why]: Because a pane and a page should say the same thing.
