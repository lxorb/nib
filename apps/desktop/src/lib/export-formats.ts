/** The formats only pandoc can produce, for a machine that has it, in the order
 *  Typora lists them. The labels are product names and stay as they are; only
 *  `Presentation` is a plain noun, and it is translated where it is shown.
 *
 *  Word, RTF and ePub are not here even though pandoc writes them: Nib writes
 *  its own, with the diagrams drawn, the code coloured and the pictures carried,
 *  and one format that came out differently depending on whether a machine
 *  happened to have pandoc would be worse than either.
 *
 *  Kept apart from the exporter itself, which carries fonts and parsers the
 *  command list has no use for: this is all the palette needs at startup. */
