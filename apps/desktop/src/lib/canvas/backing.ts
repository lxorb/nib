/** What backs a layer of ink.
 *
 *  `desynchronized` is not the same canvas with less latency. Chromium takes the
 *  element out of the page's paint order for it, gives it a compositor surface
 *  of its own and allocates its pixels as a buffer the display may scan out
 *  directly. Where that buffer keeps no alpha channel, a layer meant to be
 *  transparent composites as opaque black: the plane is black all over, and
 *  clearing the layer leaves black rather than nothing, so lifting the pen hides
 *  the stroke that was just written instead of settling it.
 *
 *  Nothing reports any of that. A 2d context's `getContextAttributes()` hands
 *  back the attributes it was asked for and says nothing about what was done
 *  with them, so a page cannot learn that the hint was taken and the alpha
 *  dropped. The hint is therefore asked for only where it is known to be
 *  honoured with alpha, what the browser does report is read as a ceiling and
 *  never as proof, and a layer whose backing is in any doubt is drawn the
 *  ordinary way. Ink that is there is worth more than ink that is there a frame
 *  sooner. */
