/** Whether the HTML in a document is markup or is words.
 *
 *  Nib renders a note the way Typora does: raw HTML in it is markup, and it runs.
 *  That is a feature of a local document, and the reasoning behind it holds
 *  exactly as far as "you wrote it". A note that came from somebody else - a
 *  member of a shared space, a peer typing in a room, a guest a link let in, a
 *  paste off the web - is a document from outside, and a document from outside is
 *  shown as the characters it is made of. The renderer already knows how; see
 *  `escapeHtml` in @nib/markdown, which is what a published page is rendered
 *  with, and for the same reason.
 *
 *  Two things decide it, because two things are what the app can actually know:
 *  who may reach the space the document sits in, and what has arrived in the
 *  document itself. The rule is here, on its own and with nothing else in it, so
 *  that the reading view, a canvas card and anything after them cannot come to
 *  different answers about the same note. */
