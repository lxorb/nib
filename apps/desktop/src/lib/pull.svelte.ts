/** Pulling down past the top of the note or the list, which is a phone's one
 *  spare gesture.
 *
 *  A phone has no keyboard to hang a shortcut off and no room for a row of
 *  buttons at the top of the screen, and there is exactly one movement a thumb
 *  can make that means nothing else: pulling a surface that is already at its top
 *  further down. Obsidian spends it on the command palette. Nib spends it on
 *  whichever command the reader says, and offers search to begin with - what a
 *  thumb reaches for on a phone is a note, and search is how a note is found.
 *
 *  The command is a registry id, like the buttons on the bar, and it runs through
 *  the same `runEntry`: the pull, the button and the key all press one command.
 *
 *  **Never the browser's own pull.** In a PWA a pull at the top of a scrolling
 *  document is pull-to-refresh, which would throw the page away and rebuild it -
 *  the one thing a note editor must never do by accident. Three things stop it,
 *  and all three were already true of this app: the window is pinned, so the
 *  document itself never scrolls; `html` says `overscroll-behavior: none` in
 *  base.css and the file list says `contain` on its own scroller; and the move
 *  handler here is not passive and prevents the default as soon as the gesture
 *  is this one.
 *
 *  The maths is here and pure; the wiring is `follow`. See pull.test.ts. */
