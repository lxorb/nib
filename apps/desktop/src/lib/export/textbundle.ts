 *  `assets` folder - written down at textbundle.org. Version 2 of it is what
 *  every reader supports, and `type` names the flavour of markdown inside, which
 *  for a note written here is plain markdown.
 *
 *  A folder cannot be downloaded, so a browser is handed the same thing zipped
 *  up, which the spec calls a TextPack. Same files, same paths, one entry per
 *  file under the bundle's own name. */
