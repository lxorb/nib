/** How hard the model is asked to think.
 *
 *  The list is the API's own, read off the error it answers an invalid one with on
 *  2026-09-09, so it is the API's and not a guess.
 *
 *  Which models may be chosen is not here any more, and neither is any way of
 *  reaching OpenAI. The account's key is written and never read back, so the request
 *  that lists the models is made by the Worker, which is the only thing that can
 *  open the key; the pane asks Nib for the list. See services/sync/src/ask and
 *  offered.svelte.ts. */
