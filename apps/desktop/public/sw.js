/** Nib's asset worker: the disk the browser build does not have.
 *
 *  A note writes `![](pictures/x.png)`, and that is the path the note keeps - in
 *  Nib, in Obsidian, in a text editor. On a desktop the webview is handed a URL
 *  for the file; in a browser the picture is a row in IndexedDB and the path is
 *  asked of the page's origin, where nothing answers. So the store gets an address
 *  and this answers it. See src/lib/web/asset-route.ts, which is the page's half
 *  of the same agreement.
 *
 *  It answers `/asset/…` and it touches nothing else. No app shell is cached, on
 *  purpose: a worker that serves the page would serve yesterday's page, and
 *  "nothing I changed reached the device" is the one bug nobody can see.
 *
 *  Plain JavaScript at the root of the site rather than a module built with the
 *  app, because a service worker is fetched before the app exists and runs where
 *  the app does not: `public/` puts this at `/sw.js` in dev and in the build
 *  alike, at the scope it needs, with no build step to keep in step and no
 *  browser left out - module service workers are still not everywhere. The price
 *  is that the three things below are said twice; asset-route.test.ts reads this
 *  file and holds the two copies to each other. */
