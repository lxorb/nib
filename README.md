If you're also annoyed by all the other Markdown Editors out there, you should probably just use nibeditor. 

It's extremely fast, lightweight, lets your favorite LLM edit your notes and syncs everything to the cloud - on any platform. 

How much does it cost? Well, it's free.

## Install

Download an installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/lxorb/nibeditor/releases/latest), open [nibeditor.com](https://nibeditor.com) in a browser, or use a package manager:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Windows, Scoop | `scoop bucket add lxorb https://github.com/lxorb/scoop-bucket` then `scoop install nib` |
| Windows, Chocolatey | `choco install nib` |
| macOS, Homebrew | `brew install --cask --no-quarantine lxorb/tap/nib` |
| Nix | `nix profile install github:lxorb/nibeditor?dir=packaging/nix` |
| Debian, Ubuntu | `sudo apt install ./Nib-<version>-linux-x64.deb` |
| Fedora, openSUSE | `sudo dnf install ./Nib-<version>-linux-x64.rpm` |
| Any Linux | `chmod +x Nib-<version>-linux-x64.AppImage && ./Nib-<version>-linux-x64.AppImage` |

The desktop app keeps itself up to date: it looks every few hours, downloads what it finds and installs it as you quit, so the new version is what starts next time. Which stream it follows is one setting, in Settings, General, Updates, and it belongs to that machine rather than to your account: **Stable** takes the official releases and is where every install starts, **Unstable** takes the build of every push to main and can break. Switching to Stable keeps the build you are on until a release passes it; switching to Unstable takes the next push. The web app is the new version the moment you reload it, and the Android app has no updater.

## Motivation

I’ve spent the last few years switching between different editors with markdown support, but kept being disappointed: Notion is way too bloated, Obsidian is proprietary and MarkText feels unfinished. Nothing against MarkText, I really liked it and have been using it for a few months, but there’s just stuff missing: you can’t sync and also even though the UI looks nice, it feels a bit clunky and unfinished at places. People will tell you to use a shared mount to have sync but then still, I won’t be able to sync it to my mobile device. And I find it really important to be able to sync your notes between your phone and computer, e.g. when taking some notes you can’t always just pull up your laptop :)
So… long story short: I’ve decided to build my own Markdown Editor. I know there’s a lot of them out there, but there’s just not a single one that makes me happy. And I believe my reasoning should become clear when looking at the comparison table above.

I aim to keep this free forever (because I really don’t wanna become the Typora 2.0). For now, I’ve limited cloud space usage to 1 GB per account - I believe this should be more than enough, but if you run into any issues, let me know.

If you’re still unsure whether you should use MarkText or nibeditor, here are a few reasons to use nibeditor. This is not to say I don’t like MarkText whatsoever, it’s just why I am not satisfied with it:
- nibeditor is by construction considerably faster and lighter (around 20x compared to MarkText)
- nibeditor has an MCP so your favorite LLM can mess with your notes, MarkText doesn’t
- nibeditor has sync on all of your devices, MarkText is just local
- Have you thought about starting an online blog? Well, it’s one click away now.
