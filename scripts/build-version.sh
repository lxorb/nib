# What a build is called, decided once for every platform and every workflow.
#
# Two kinds of build come out of the repository. A tag `v*` is a release proper,
# with its own page and its own number. Every push to main is a build as well:
# what is on main is what people run, not only what was last tagged, so those
# builds land on one rolling pre-release, replaced each time. The tag it lands on
# is the argument, because the desktop installers and the phone apps roll on
# separate ones - a desktop build deletes and remakes its release, which would
# take an APK uploaded beside it with it.
#
# One patch past the newest tag, with a pre-release number that only ever goes
# up. Semver puts 0.1.2-57 above 0.1.1 and below 0.1.2, so the app takes each
# main build and then the release that follows. Digits only in the pre-release,
# because the MSI bundler turns it into a fourth version number and accepts
# nothing else there.
#
# Writes `version`, `tag` and `rolling` to the step's outputs.
