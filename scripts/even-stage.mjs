/* The folder that goes into an .ehpk.

   Two jobs, and both are about what a package is allowed to contain.

   **Both names are the plugin.** Which page the phone app opens from a package is
   published nowhere: the manifest names `even.html` as the entrypoint, but an app
   that ignored the manifest and opened `index.html` would get whatever is under
   that name. So this writes the plugin under both, and the question is removed
   rather than answered.

   **No URL the manifest does not allow.** The store's own review refuses a bundle
   that carries one:

     Bundle contains URLs not covered by `network.whitelist`.

   Almost all of them came from libraries a pair of glasses cannot use, and those
   are not in the plugin's build at all now; see apps/desktop/vite.even.config.ts.
   What is left is a handful of error links, and they are rewritten here, where the
   folder is only ever read by the packer:

     - Svelte's `https://svelte.dev/e/<code>` becomes `<code>`, which is what
       identifies the error anyway. The message still says which one it was.
     - the XML namespaces under `www.w3.org` are kept exactly, spelled with the
       escape their own file's syntax reads as a slash: they are what an element is
       in rather than somewhere to fetch, and a mangled one draws nothing. See
       `NAMESPACES` below, which is a bug Emil found on his phone.
     - anything else keeps its host and path and loses its scheme, so a string that
       was there to be read still reads and nothing in the package is a URL.

   `apps/desktop/src/lib/even/bundle.test.ts` holds the staged folder to both of
   the review's findings, so neither can come back.

 *  and an element in a namespace that does not exist is drawn as nothing at all.
 *
 *  Emil, on his phone: *"I don't see the icons of the spaces on the Even Realities
 *  plugin right now."* This was one of the two reasons: the icons were in the DOM,
 *  in white, the right size and in the right place, and every `<path>` in them was
 *  an unknown element in `www.w3.org/2000/svg`. It took the chevron off every select
 *  with it, and every equation KaTeX draws as MathML.
 *
 *  So they are kept, and spelled so that nothing in the package reads as a URL. Each
 *  spelling is the ordinary escape of the file's own syntax and means the same
 *  string to whatever reads it. */
