/** Renames built bundles to something a person can read before downloading.
 *
 *  Tauri names them after build triples and packaging conventions, so the same
 *  release carries `Nib_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`, `Nib_0.1.0_amd64.AppImage` and
 *  `Nib-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm` - three spellings of the architecture and no word
 *  saying which operating system any of them is for.
 *
 *    node scripts/name-assets.mjs artifacts 0.1.0
 *
 *  Each artifact directory is named `nib-<platform>-<arch>` by the build
 *  matrix, which is exactly the label the file should carry. Underneath it the
 *  uploader keeps Tauri's own `nsis/`, `msi/`, `dmg/` folders, so the search
 *  goes all the way down rather than one level. Signatures are renamed with
 *  the bundle they belong to, so the update manifest still pairs them up.
